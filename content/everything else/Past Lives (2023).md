- The movie feels very "lifeful" and natural. I was wondering if there are any scripts because everybody just act so natural. The look Na Young gives to Hae Sung, the smile, the way they stand, sit, walk. Everything feels like they are not acting at all.
- I can see that the director focused on really small details
  - The first goodbye when Na Young first go aboard: she walks up the stair and he just walks straight. I somehow relate this technique from Parasite.
  - The scene where Hae Sung, Na Young and her husband at the bar: the way the director cuts the husband off from the frame, and relate it to the beginning of the film where strangers are talking about them, wondering if the two Asian are couples.
  - She did a quite amount of long shots which give the movie even more "natural theme".
- Interesting things from the movie:
  - The poem that one student reads to Na Young: "I crossed Pacific Ocean to be here. Some crossings cost more than others. **Some crossing you pay for with your whole life**"
  - A korean term "In-yun": it says that if anything happens between two people (even the touch of their clothes), something must happened in their past lives.
  - The way Na Young's husband talk about how she dreams in Korean when she sleeps as a metaphor for her actual dream (for her life) in Korean.
- The ending scene brought us to tears.
