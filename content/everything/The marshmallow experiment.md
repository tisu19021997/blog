- **The experiment:** they give the kids a marshmallow and tell them if they wait for 15 minutes more, they will double the marshmallow.
	- **The result:** kids that accepted to wait to double the marshmallow were more successful in life than kids that didn't.
- Instant gratification vs delayed gratification:
	- Instant: eat junks, drink beer, do drugs etc. â†’ give instant gratification.
	- Delayed: study, go to the gym, exercise, etc.
- Baseline happiness: the normal happiness level of a human.
	- Each person have a baseline happiness, when you do **instant gratification**, your level of happiness has a spike. But after that, your **baseline happiness is lower**.
	- When doing delayed gratification, your level of happiness is lowered, but then it bounces back and **increases your baseline happiness a little.**

So, avoid instant gratification and start doing things that good for your future self guys.
