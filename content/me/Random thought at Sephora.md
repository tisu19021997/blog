- going to the US doesn't make me a better person, ofc. I learned some things, but it didn't boost my confidence after all. maybe I just understand myself better - what I really am and how shy I am.
- maybe I'm just me - a guy who doesn't like crowds and shit. a guy who feels better sitting in front of his computer than meeting people. I love outdoor activities, but that doesn't mean I love seeing people.
