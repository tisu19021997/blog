This guy from the video briefly explained how the [[science/Stable Diffusion|Stable Diffusion]] work (it just denoised the image until the image matches the prompt). 

He also argued against the argument "Art is discovered, not created" (i.e, they are just different combinations of pixel on the screen).

**His point**: the laws of physic or math are already there, but it always needed one (Einstein or Pythagoras) to observed, to figure it out. An observer is a must. So we (designers) are still important guys, don't worry. So art may be just discovered, but they always need discoverers.

*IMO, this argument is great, and it's a perfect counter-argument.*
