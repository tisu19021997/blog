"""

In a world where technical problems are half-solve, where everyone can create art using a piece of text, **taste** is what remains important in making art.

Taste is the navigation tool in art process, guiding the designer to creat their unique work from a sea of inspiration.

> “I’ve come to believe that developing taste is not so unlike going to therapy; it’s an inefficient, time-consuming process that mostly entails looking inward and identifying whatever already moves you“


"""

To myself: start printing Bauhaus art or whatever art you love Quang, *anything that moves you or you can’t look away.*
