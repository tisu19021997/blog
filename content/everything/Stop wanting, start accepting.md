# The video
- This video comes up with a story about a couple Cam and his girl. He works in business and she is a digital artist (or something like that).
- They moved a lot between cities and also between jobs. Cam usually feels pointless after some time at one job, so he switches. 
- After moving to Houston, they usually walk around. One day, they meet a man digging a hole in front of his house. They say hello and he says "All's in a day work.". 
- From that day, every time they walk passed the house, they always say the man digging the hole at the same spot (the hole somehow fills back after he digs it, it means he starts from the beginning again every morning and never achieve anything) and saying the same thing. They feel weird and ask him what is he digging. He says he's making a Koi pond for his son. 
- After the conversation, Cam and his girl realize that he may have dementia or brain damage (he forgets what he did yesterday). They feel bad for him.
- Another day, when walking alone, Cam meets the man again. The man is digging the hole and says hello. This time, Cam can see he's smiling and point into the sky. He says "What a beautiful day. Just gorgeous!"" Cam looks in the sky and in that moment, he realizes that the guy may be happy with his job.
# Reflect
- "Whether it ends up being finished or not, in his head, today, he's just digging.". This what Cam says to his girl when they have a conversation about the man.
	- This sentence really touches me somehow. 
- Long story short, we should feel happy that we can still be with the people we love, we can still enjoy a beautiful day, drinking a coffee, eating a bánh mì. Maybe the work won't change but everyday is a variable, everyday is different, just enjoy the day.
