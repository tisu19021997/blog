- A page is divided into **3 sections**:
	1. Q section: questions that are used after taking the note to review and understand the lecture.
	2. Note section: normal note taking in here.
	3. Summary section: answer the question "What did we learned today?"
- Maybe the Q section content can be put on flashcards or [[Anki]] to repeat learning the concept/lecture.
