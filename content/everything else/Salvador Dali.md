- He rooted in Impressionism. He studied in an art school in Madrid, later he was expelled because he chased modern art, not traditional one, so called "anti-art".
- To me, he's fucking cool. He almost mastered many different art styles.
	- His works are usually spacious. It also tells a story. 
- He also had "annual wrapped" paintings where he included many scientific breakthroughs, historical events, etc. in his large paintings (called masterworks).
