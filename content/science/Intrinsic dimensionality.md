> [!Summary]
> **Intrinsic dimensionality** of a space is the number of required* pieces of information that we need to describe each object in a space.
> 
> **Extrinsic dimensionality** of a space is the number of pieces *we are using* to describe the space.

# Definitions
---
- **Space**: <ins>set</ins> of object with some structure.
	- 3D space: set of all points in a 3 dimensions.
- **Dimensions**: D-dimension space is one in which a **D** information required to describe each object in the space.

# Example
---
- Although the space below is 3D, we can represent each point on the paper with only 2 pieces of information (in red).
	- We can infer the the 3D coordinate from the 2D point.
